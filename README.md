# Identity-Authentication-Using-Face-Verification-and-ID-Image-Recognition-
We designed a service that uses face verification and ID card recognition to perform personal identity authentication automatically. First, the user supposed to create an account by choosing an email and password and entering contact information. After creating an account, user logs in the application with his/her email and password. If the user logs in successfully, the user supposed to upload a photo of the ID card. The program extracts and verifies data in real time automatically from the ID card. Then the program will take video and extracts a few photos from the video to catch the users face correctly. System will compare the photo on the ID card with the photo taken from camera and gives a result. If all the stages are passed, the identity authentication will be validated in seconds automatically.
